Transmission Line fault Detection
This is an IoT(Internet of things) based project
Now a days transmission line protection is a key problem in power transmission lines because (85-87) percentage of power system disturbances are occurring in 
transmission lines. Identification of fault source is tedious task; fast fault detection 
can help to protect the equipment before any significant damage of the equipment. 
The exact fault location can help service man to remove persistent of the faults and 
locate the areas where the faults occur regularly, thus reducing the occurrence of 
fault and minimize the time of power outages. The paper is intended to detect the 
location of fault in transmission line using an Arduino board and the same is 
transmitted to control Centre using Arduino nano device. In this proposed thesis, 
we sense the current by placing the conducting wire inside the loop of the current 
transformer and is given to the protective circuit to avoid the high current. This is 
given to the Arduino Nano(microcontroller). The fire sensor (An IR Receiver) is 
given to the Arduino to detect the presence of any fire. In case there is a short 
circuit, the current in the series resistors modifies accordingly to the resistance that 
modifies with the distance and the load which is connected through a relay to the 
Arduino is turned OFF when the resistance is below threshold value. In addition, 
this thesis can also be empowered by using capacitor in the AC circuit to measures 
the impedance that could also locate the open circuit cable. An LCD display will 
indicate the status of the transmission lines and buzzer will sound when fault is 
detected. The SMS alerts will be going to be sent to the corresponding number 
through GSM Modem.
